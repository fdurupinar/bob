# BOB git mirror #

BoB is a collaborative assistant for biocuration developed by IHMC together with University of Rochester, Harvard School of Medicine, SIFT, and others. The project is funded by DARPA under the Communication with Computers (CwC) program.

This git repo is a mirror of the TRIPS `bob` CVS module. It is updated nightly.

Note that the `src/config/lisp/defsystem/defsystem-3.6i/` directory contains a modified, non-standard, non-official version of [MK:DEFSYSTEM](http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem) 3.6i. See the comments near the top of `defsystem.lisp` in that directory for its copyright notice and license.
